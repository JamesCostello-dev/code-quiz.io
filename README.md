## Purpose 
* AS A coding boot camp student

* SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

* GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
* WHEN I click the start button
* THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
* WHEN I answer a question
* THEN I am presented with another question
* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
* THEN time is subtracted from the clock
* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
* THEN the game is over
